//! # agentkit
//!
//! Composable building blocks for agentic loops.
//!
//! `agentkit` is a feature-gated umbrella crate that re-exports every crate in
//! the agentkit workspace. Enable only the features you need and access them
//! through a single dependency.
//!
//! ## Default features
//!
//! The following modules are available with default features enabled:
//!
//! | Feature | Module | Contents |
//! |---|---|---|

//! | `tools` | [`tools`] | Tool abstractions: [`tools::Tool`], [`tools::ToolRegistry`], [`tools::ToolSpec`], permission types |
//! | `loop` | [`loop_`] | Agent loop: [`loop_::Agent`], [`loop_::AgentBuilder`], [`loop_::LoopDriver`], [`loop_::LoopStep`] |
//! | `reporting` | [`reporting`] | Loop observers: [`reporting::StdoutReporter`], [`reporting::JsonlReporter`], [`reporting::UsageReporter`] |
//!

//!
//! ## Example: building and running an agent
//!
//! This example uses the `provider-openrouter` and `reporting` features to
//! build a minimal agent, submit a user message, and drive the loop until the
//! model finishes its turn.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use agentkit::core::{Item, ItemKind};
//! use agentkit::loop_::{
//!     Agent, LoopStep, PromptCacheRequest, PromptCacheRetention, SessionConfig,
//! };
//! use agentkit::provider_openrouter::{OpenRouterAdapter, OpenRouterConfig};
//! use agentkit::reporting::StdoutReporter;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let adapter = OpenRouterAdapter::new(OpenRouterConfig::from_env()?)?;
//!
//!     let agent = Agent::builder()
//!         .model(adapter)
//!         .observer(StdoutReporter::new(std::io::stdout()))
//!         .build()?;
//!
//!     let mut driver = agent
//!         .start(
//!             SessionConfig::new("demo").with_cache(
//!                 PromptCacheRequest::automatic().with_retention(PromptCacheRetention::Short),
//!             ),
//!         )
//!         .await?;
//!
//!     driver.submit_input(vec![Item::text(
//!         ItemKind::User,
//!         "What is the capital of France?",
//!     )])?;
//!
//!     loop {
//!         match driver.next().await? {
//!             LoopStep::Finished(result) => {
//!                 println!("Finished: {:?}", result.finish_reason);
//!                 break;
//!             }
//!             LoopStep::Interrupt(interrupt) => {
//!                 // Resolve the interrupt (approval, auth, or input) then continue.
//!                 println!("Interrupt: {interrupt:?}");
//!                 break; // a real app would resolve and loop
//!             }
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Example: composing reporters
//!
//! Multiple [`loop_::LoopObserver`] implementations can be combined through
//! [`reporting::CompositeReporter`] so that a single loop feeds several
//! observers at once.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use agentkit::reporting::{
//!     CompositeReporter, JsonlReporter, UsageReporter, TranscriptReporter,
//! };
//!
//! let reporter = CompositeReporter::new()
//!     .with_observer(JsonlReporter::new(Vec::new()))
//!     .with_observer(UsageReporter::new())
//!     .with_observer(TranscriptReporter::new());
//! ```
