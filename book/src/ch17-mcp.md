# MCP integration

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) lets agents discover and use tools, resources, and prompts from external servers. This chapter covers [`agentkit-mcp`](https://github.com/danielkov/agentkit/tree/main/crates/agentkit-mcp): how MCP fits into the capability and tool layers, how auth and lifecycle are managed, and how the client surfaces server-initiated requests and events.

## What MCP solves

Without MCP, every external integration is a custom tool. Connecting to GitHub means writing a GitHub tool. Connecting to a database means writing a database tool. Each one has bespoke connection logic, auth handling, and discovery.

MCP standardizes this: external servers expose capabilities through a uniform protocol, and the agent discovers them at runtime instead of compile time.

Without MCP:                          With MCP:

  Agent                                Agent
  ├── GitHubTool (custom)              ├── MCP client
  ├── DatabaseTool (custom)            │   ├── github-server (discovered)
  ├── SlackTool (custom)               │   ├── database-server (discovered)
  └── JiraTool (custom)                │   └── slack-server (discovered)
                                       │
  Each tool: custom code,              Each server: standard protocol,
  custom auth, custom schema           standard auth, standard schema
```

`agentkit-mcp` is built on top of the official [`rmcp`](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp) Rust SDK. The wire-protocol types (`CallToolResult`, `ReadResourceResult`, `Content`, `Tool`, `Prompt`, …) are re-exported as `McpTool`, `McpResource`, `McpPrompt`, etc. — there is no parallel agentkit-side vocabulary.

## Built on rmcp: spec changes propagate for free

The MCP specification moves quickly. Because agentkit-mcp re-exports [`rmcp::model`](https://docs.rs/rmcp/latest/rmcp/model/index.html) types as-is rather than wrapping them in a parallel hierarchy, new fields, content variants, capability flags, server-initiated requests, and notification payloads land in agentkit hosts the moment `rmcp` ships them — there is no agentkit-flavored "view" of the wire format to keep in sync.

- **Spec:** [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
- **Rust SDK:** [`rmcp` on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/rmcp)

The same logic applies to transports: stdio and Streamable HTTP are rmcp implementations driven declaratively here; future rmcp transports are reachable through `McpConnection::from_running_service_with_events` without touching `McpTransportBinding`.

## MCP in the capability model

MCP servers expose three capability types, which map directly to agentkit's capability layer:

| MCP concept   | agentkit abstraction            | How it's used                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MCP tools     | `Invocable` → adapted to `Tool` | Model calls them during turns              |
| MCP resources | `ResourceProvider`              | Host reads them for context loading        |
| MCP prompts   | `PromptProvider`                | Host renders them for transcript injection |

An MCP server implements `CapabilityProvider`, exposing all three through one registration point — `McpCapabilityProvider`.

## Server configuration

```rust,ignore
pub struct McpServerConfig {
    pub id: McpServerId,
    pub transport: McpTransportBinding,
    pub metadata: MetadataMap,
}
```

Built-in transports: **stdio** (local child process) and **Streamable HTTP** (modern remote MCP). Both are driven by rmcp's transport implementations — agentkit-mcp does not maintain its own JSON-RPC framing.

## Discovery

After connecting, the server's capabilities are captured in a snapshot of rmcp wire types:

```rust,ignore
pub struct McpDiscoverySnapshot {
    pub server_id: McpServerId,
    pub tools: Vec<McpTool>,        // = rmcp::model::Tool
    pub resources: Vec<McpResource>, // = rmcp::model::Resource (Annotated<RawResource>)
    pub prompts: Vec<McpPrompt>,     // = rmcp::model::Prompt
    pub metadata: MetadataMap,
}
```

Snapshots are cacheable and refreshable. Hosts choose which capabilities to expose — discovery doesn't automatically register everything. Pattern-matching directly against the rmcp types gives access to `output_schema`, `annotations`, `mime_type`, prompt arguments, etc. without a wrapping layer.

## Tool adaptation

`McpToolAdapter` wraps an MCP tool as a `Tool` implementation:

- exposes a `ToolSpec` derived from the `McpTool` descriptor (annotations included)
- translates `ToolRequest` into an rmcp `tools/call`
- translates `CallToolResult` (content blocks + optional `structured_content`) into a normalized `ToolResult`
- surfaces auth challenges as `ToolError::AuthRequired`

### Namespacing

MCP tools are namespaced by default as `mcp_<server_id>_<tool_name>`. This prevents collisions with native tools. Hosts can swap the strategy via `McpToolNamespace::None` (strip the prefix) or `McpToolNamespace::Custom(...)` (e.g. `remote.<server>.<tool>`):

```rust,ignore
let manager = McpServerManager::new().with_namespace(McpToolNamespace::custom(
    |server, name| format!("remote.{server}.{name}"),
));
```

## Sampling, elicitation, and roots

MCP is bidirectional: a server can ask the client to do work too. agentkit-mcp surfaces three responder traits — install one to handle each request type. The client only advertises the corresponding `ClientCapabilities` entry when a responder is wired in, so servers see exactly the surface the host opted into.

| Server request           | Trait                     | Use                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `sampling/createMessage` | `McpSamplingResponder`    | Server asks the host LLM to generate a completion |
| `elicitation/create`     | `McpElicitationResponder` | Server asks the user for input                    |
| `roots/list`             | `McpRootsProvider`        | Server enumerates workspace roots in scope        |

```rust,ignore
let manager = McpServerManager::new().with_handler_config(
    McpHandlerConfig::new()
        .with_sampling_responder(Arc::new(host_sampling))
        .with_elicitation_responder(Arc::new(prompt_user))
        .with_roots_provider(Arc::new(workspace_roots)),
);
```

## Server-pushed events

Servers also push notifications: progress updates for long-running tools, log messages, resource updates the client subscribed to, list-changed announcements, and cancellation. Subscribe to `McpConnection::subscribe_events` to receive them as `McpServerEvent`:

```rust,ignore
let mut events = connection.subscribe_events();
connection.subscribe_resource("memo:welcome").await?;
while let Ok(event) = events.recv().await {
    match event {
        McpServerEvent::Progress(progress) => /* update UI */ {},
        McpServerEvent::Logging(message)   => /* write to log */ {},
        McpServerEvent::ResourceUpdated(_) => /* re-read resource */ {},
        McpServerEvent::ToolListChanged
        | McpServerEvent::ResourceListChanged
        | McpServerEvent::PromptListChanged => /* refresh discovery */ {},
        McpServerEvent::Cancelled(_)       => /* stop in-flight work */ {},
    }
}
```

`set_logging_level(LoggingLevel::Info)` negotiates the minimum severity the server emits. `subscribe_resource` / `unsubscribe_resource` toggle per-URI watch on resources that support it.

List-changed events are _also_ delivered through the legacy `McpServerNotification` mpsc receiver that `McpServerManager::refresh_changed_catalogs` drains to re-run discovery — the two channels coexist: events for live UI/observability, mpsc for catalog re-sync.

## Auth handled outside the loop

MCP auth challenges are explicit, but they are **not** a loop interrupt. The loop's interrupt set is intentionally narrow (approval + cooperative yields); auth is an MCP concern and lives on the manager.

1. A tool invocation triggers an auth requirement.
2. The tool adapter returns `ToolError::AuthRequired(AuthRequest)`.
3. The driver records the failure on the transcript as a tool error so the model can see the call did not complete.
4. The host (which holds the `McpServerManager`) reads the `AuthRequest` — either from the tool error or from a non-tool operation that returned `McpError::AuthRequired(_)` — runs whatever flow it needs (OAuth, API key entry, secret store fetch), and submits an `AuthResolution`.
5. `manager.resolve_auth(resolution).await?` stores the credentials and reconnects the affected server. The next tool call uses the fresh credentials.

```rust,ignore
manager
    .resolve_auth(AuthResolution::provided(request, credentials))
    .await?;
```

For non-tool MCP operations (connecting, reading resources, fetching prompts), `manager.resolve_auth_and_resume(resolution)` resolves credentials and replays the original operation in one call. The connection-level `McpConnection::replay_auth_operation(operation)` is exposed for hosts that drive auth without going through the manager.

Auth is never hidden retry logic. The host always knows when auth is happening and controls the flow. To rotate credentials at runtime — e.g. a Streamable HTTP bearer that expires every hour — drive an `AuthResolution::Provided { credentials, .. }` through `McpServerManager::resolve_auth`; the manager reconnects with the new credentials. Plug an `McpAuthResponder` into `McpHandlerConfig` to handle challenges automatically without surfacing them to the host loop at all.

## Lifecycle

The manager owns server lifecycle:

| Method                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect_server(id)` / `connect_all()` | Open a connection and run discovery                                                                                                     |
| `connect_all_settled()`                | Attempt all registered servers concurrently, install successes, and return per-server failures                                          |
| `refresh_server(id)`                   | Re-run discovery and emit per-tool/resource/prompt diff events                                                                          |
| `refresh_changed_catalogs()`           | Drain pending `*list_changed` notifications and refresh affected catalogs                                                               |
| `disconnect_server(id)`                | Close the connection, drop tools from the federated catalog, emit `ServerDisconnected`                                                  |
| `subscribe_catalog_events()`           | Broadcast receiver for `McpCatalogEvent` (server connect / disconnect / tool added / removed / changed / refresh failed / auth changed) |

## Federating MCP into the agent

`McpServerManager::source()` returns a sized `CatalogReader` that the agent can take ownership of through `add_tool_source`. Connect, disconnect, and catalog refresh events feed straight into the loop — every `next()` re-snapshots the source and emits `AgentEvent::ToolCatalogChanged` before invoking the model again, so the model sees the current tool list every turn:

```rust,ignore
let mut manager = McpServerManager::new()
    .with_server(github_config)
    .with_server(database_config);
manager.connect_all().await?;

let agent = Agent::builder()
    .model(adapter)
    .add_tool_source(native_registry)   // built-ins
    .add_tool_source(manager.source())  // MCP-backed
    .build()?;
```

`tool_registry()` is still available for one-shot snapshots, but for long-running hosts `source()` is the right entry point — it stays correlated with the manager's catalog state through reconnects, refreshes, and `disconnect_server` calls.

## Transports

| Transport       | Connection                             | Use case                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| stdio           | Spawn child process, pipe stdin/stdout | Local tool servers         |
| Streamable HTTP | HTTP POST with JSON or SSE responses   | Modern remote tool servers |

The rest of agentkit doesn't know whether a server is reached via stdio, HTTP, or in-memory pipes. Transport is configured in `McpServerConfig` and the MCP manager handles the connection lifecycle.

### stdio transport

The most common pattern for local MCP servers. The agent spawns the server as a child process and communicates over stdin/stdout:

```text
Agent process ──── stdin ────▶ MCP server process
              ◀── stdout ────
```

This is how tools like GitHub's MCP server, filesystem tools, and database connectors typically run. The server starts on demand and exits when the agent disconnects.

### Streamable HTTP transport

For modern remote MCP servers that run as HTTP services. rmcp drives JSON-RPC over HTTP POST, accepts either JSON or SSE responses, and tracks the negotiated session/protocol headers:

```text
Agent ──── HTTP POST ────▶ Remote MCP server
      ◀── JSON or SSE ───
```

If an SSE response stream is interrupted before the matching response arrives, the client resumes with `Last-Event-ID`. Bearer tokens and arbitrary custom headers are configured declaratively on `StreamableHttpTransportConfig`.

### Custom transports

When you need a transport rmcp supports but `McpTransportBinding` does not (in-memory pipes for tests, websockets, custom IO), build the rmcp `RunningService` yourself and adopt it through `McpConnection::from_running_service_with_events`. Pair the service with the channels returned by `McpHandlerConfig::new().build()` so list-change notifications and `McpServerEvent` subscribers stay observable.

```

Native tools and MCP tools appear as a single list to the model. The model doesn't know (or need to know) which tools come from MCP and which are native. The `mcp_<server_id>_` prefix distinguishes them in the tool name for human readers and policy evaluation, but the model just sees a tool spec with a name and schema.

> **Example:** [`openrouter-mcp-tool`](https://github.com/danielkov/agentkit/tree/main/examples/openrouter-mcp-tool) demonstrates MCP tool discovery and invocation. [`openrouter-agent-cli`](https://github.com/danielkov/agentkit/tree/main/examples/openrouter-agent-cli) shows MCP integrated into a full agent with context, tools, and compaction. [`mcp-reference-interop`](https://github.com/danielkov/agentkit/tree/main/examples/mcp-reference-interop) and [`mcp-dynamic-auth`](https://github.com/danielkov/agentkit/tree/main/examples/mcp-dynamic-auth) cover transport interop and credential rotation respectively.
